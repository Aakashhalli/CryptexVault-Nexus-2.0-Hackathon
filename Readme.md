# Cryptex Vault
## Hackathon Project - ACM Nexus 2.0
### KLS Gogte Institute of Technology, Belagavi, Karnataka
We're excited to share Cryptex Vault, our project built during the Hackathon organized by ACM Student Chapter KLSGIT!

Cryptex Vault empowers digital creators to secure and manage ownership of their assets—such as music, images, and digital art—leveraging the transparency and immutability of blockchain technology.

Key Features:
1) Copyright Ownership: Creators can establish and prove copyright ownership of their digital works on-chain.

2) On-Chain Verification: Instantly verify asset ownership through blockchain records.

3) Secure Ownership Transfer: Seamlessly and securely transfer asset ownership between users.

4) Personalized Dashboard: Monitor all asset activities and transactions via a user-friendly dashboard.

Every asset uploaded is hashed using the SHA encryption algorithm, with both the hash and owner-sensitive data stored directly on the blockchain to ensure data integrity and trust. For scalability and fast access, non-sensitive metadata is managed using MongoDB.
